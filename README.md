3. Type “Dynamic Year Block” in the search field.
4. Look for the plugin with this name in the list of available block plugins and click to install.
5. Wait for the installation process and the block will be available to use in your content. You can deactivate it in the “Plugins → All plugins” menu, in your WordPress admin dashboard.

## Manual Installation:
1. Upload the dynamic-year-block.zip file via the plugin page of WordPress by clicking “Add New” and selecting the zip from your local computer, or alternatively upload the decompressed `dynamic-year-block` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your server, via SFTP/FTP.
2. Activate the plugin through the “Plugins” menu in WordPress.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why would I need this?
This eliminates the need to manually edit the year of your website's copyright statement,  usually located at the bottom of each page.

## What is the recommended way to use it?
It is recommended to insert it in the footer template part of your block's theme, but it can be used anywhere in your content.

## Will this plugin hinder my website loading performance?
Not at all, the plugin is quite simple. It does not add any CSS or Javascript on its own. If you want to style the text in any way, you will use the Block Editor's native features to do so.

## Does this plugin collect any data from me or my users?
Absolutely not, the plugin respects your privacy. It's completely add-free and the code only uses core WordPress functions.

## Does this plugin work in the Classic Editor?
No, this plugin works exclusively in the Block Editor.

## Is the included copyright notice enough to safeguard my website regarding legal issues? =
Most probably not. While the plugin offers a basic copyright notice, it doesn't automatically solve all legal issues your website may have, nor does it constitute legal advice in any way. The site owner is solely responsible for ensuring that the website respects the law.

## Does the plugin use the client time (via Javascript) or the server time (via PHP) to update the year?
The plugin uses a WordPress core function ([`current_datetime`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/current_datetime/)) to get your server time, using the timezone specified in the “Settings → General → Timezone” on your WordPress dashboard. So it is important to set your timezone in order to display the year correctly, especially at the turn of the year.
