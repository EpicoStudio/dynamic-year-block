A simple block that always displays the current year.

== Description ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Search for the “Current year” block in any block inserter within the block editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I send feedback or support questions? =
Please reach out via the official [plugin support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/current-year).

= Is there a Github repo for this plugin? =

Yes, there is, [visit the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Uberfacil/current-year).

= Is this a static or a dynamic block? =

This is a dynamic block, as it is recommended to set the current year dinamically, based on your server time in conjunction with your specific timezone.

= Does the plugin use the client (via Javascript) or the server time (via PHP) to update the year? =

The plugin uses a WordPress core function ([`current_datetime`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/current_datetime/)) to get your server time with using timezone specified in the “Settings → General → Timezone” on your WordPress dashboard, so it is important to set your timezone in order to display the year correctly, especially at the turn of the year.

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
